# gallery

This is a gallery of pufferfish images that is fully accessible. You can select everything with tab and pressing Enter, and can also use the arrow keys to switch between the images.

I achieved creating a gallery with thumbnails you can click on and buttons that switch the images. I made this website fully accessible.

~~I cannot figure out what is causing the white background at the bottom of the page under the image. I believe it is a CSS issue but I cannot figure out what it is. This is a goal i cannot achieve and I would like to figure out what is wrong with it.~~

With the assistance of another student i have managed to figure out my previous issue (thank you darren).
